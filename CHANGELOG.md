## Session 2026-03-28 — Web App Integration Live + Extraction Bug Discovery + Disk Optimization

**Focus:** Wire `apps/api/` into the Next.js web app, achieve first end-to-end test, diagnose pipeline failure, and minimize per-run disk usage for hosting readiness.

**What was done:**
1. Fixed `apps/api/main.py` import bug: added `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))` so `from pipeline import ...` works when run as `uvicorn apps.api.main:app` from the project root.
2. Updated Quick Start commands in `CLAUDE.md` for Windows/PowerShell syntax.
3. Cross-checked the Next.js agent's integration plan against the API contract; identified 7 gaps.
4. First end-to-end test: web app submitted job → Python server received and processed → callback delivered `result_json` → web app displayed results.
5. **Bug discovered:** `extract_selected_features.py` exits 0 even when all videos fail (line 1624). Pipeline continues silently with empty feature directories; scoring stage produces misleading "Features JSON not found" error. Error message also truncated to 100 chars at line 1581.
6. Documented fusion score display contract: `neural_score` IS the fusion output (`heuristic + tanh(residual) × 40`). Three-judge model (BiLSTM / ST-GCN / Heuristic) documented.
7. **Disk optimization for API runs:** Pass `--no-viz --no-report` to stages 2.5 and 5. Delete input video after extraction. Call `_cleanup_workspace()` post-results. Net: ~6.9 MB → ~25 KB per run.

## Session 2026-03-17 — Stage 5 Strict Sequencing + Annotation Controls

**Part 1: Strict Phase Sequencing**
**Focus:** Force deterministic phase ordering while preserving shallow-squat detection.

**What was built:**
1. Enforced strict global adjacency in `core/exevision/stages/temporal_segmentation.py` with sanitizer passes after `detect_phases()` and after `_enforce_minimum_durations()`
2. Constrained legal cycle to: `idle -> eccentric -> [isometric] -> concentric -> idle`
3. Restricted `isometric` entry to `eccentric -> isometric` only, requiring >1 second of stillness while knees remain bent
4. Preserved shallow reps by reducing motion thresholds and lowering confirmation latency, while limiting anti-jitter merging to ultra-short flicker segments only
5. Added explicit metadata reporting via `analysis_params.strict_phase_sequence` and `analysis_params.illegal_transition_repairs`

**Part 2: Annotation Process Controls**
**Focus:** Make annotation processing mode-selectable and keep annotation labels safe during reprocess.

**What was built:**
1. Added extraction mode dropdown to Annotation tab with `Filtered` (default) and `Unfiltered (raw)` options
2. Wired selected mode into stage 2.5 execution for both single-video and batch pipeline paths
3. Changed **Reprocess Selected** semantics to preserve annotation JSON files, resetting only pipeline reference fields before re-running
4. Updated status messaging to show active extraction mode while queueing jobs

## Session 2026-03-15 — UI Polish & Batch Setup

**Focus:** Vastly improve UI responsiveness, throughput efficiency, and data collection nuance in Annotation tool.

**What was built:**
1. **Multi-Video Batching:** Video listbox now supports extended selection; users can queue dozens of videos for sequential background processing
2. **Async Folder Scanning:** Moved folder scanning to background thread; dropping thousands of videos no longer freezes UI on startup
3. **Color-Coded Status UI:** Listbox auto-paints rows (green=processed, red=unprocessed, checkmark=annotated) via thread-safe callbacks
4. **Indeterminate Progress:** Added `ttk.Progressbar` and success messagebox to indicate batch queue completion
5. **Heuristic Reference Panel:** Exposed raw biomechanical metrics (Depth Ratio, Knee Angle, Valgus, Trunk Lean) on right side for annotator reference
6. **Spectrum Severity Scaling:**
   - Replaced binary checkboxes with 0–5 sliders for six biomechanical faults
   - Removed mutually exclusive "Correct Form" flag (movement quality is spectrum, not binary)
   - Intertwined sliders & checkboxes: dragging >0 auto-checks; unchecking snaps to 0
7. **`analyze_annotations.py` Update:** Modified CLI to sum/average continuous severities instead of binary counts

## Session 2026-03-11 (Part 1) — Annotation Tool Launch

**Focus:** Design and implement human annotation tool in `apps/desktop-ui/app.py`.

**What was built:**

1. **`AnnotationToolUI` class** (entire new workflow in Notebook tab):
   - Folder-based video browser with status markers (`✓` complete, `(2/3)` partial)
   - Auto-detection of existing pipeline output (newest-first search in `pipeline_ui_runs/`)
   - Auto-pipeline execution (stages 2.5→4→5→8) in background if no output exists
   - Rep-by-rep video playback using visualization videos (safer than annotated overlays)
   - Bias-blind scoring: heuristic hidden until human score submitted → revealed with Δ
   - F1–F5 keyboard shortcuts for annotation flags
   - Per-video JSON storage at `training_dataset/annotations/videos/{video_id}.json`
   - `index.json` master list updated on every submit
   - Resume support: reloads existing annotation files on video click

2. **`core/exevision/analysis/select_annotation_samples.py`** (strategic rep subset selection):
   - Priority 1: boundary reps (scores 45–55, 65–75, 80–90)
   - Priority 2: view-stratified equal sampling
   - Priority 3: score extremes (top + bottom)
   - Priority 4: random fill
   - Gracefully handles small pools

3. **`core/exevision/analysis/analyze_annotations.py`** (quality self-check):
   - Score distributions, human-heuristic correlation, disagreement stats
   - Training-readiness warnings (correlation >0.95, variance <10, disagreement std <3, count <50)

4. **`main()` modified** to use `ttk.Notebook` with two tabs: Inference (PipelineRunnerUI) and Annotation (AnnotationToolUI)

## Session 2026-03-11 (Part 2) — Pipeline Path Fixes

**Focus:** Restore end-to-end support for Unfiltered runs without changing downstream logic.

**Root-cause diagnosis & fix:**

**Issue: Pipeline path mismatch for raw BlazePose outputs**
- **Symptom:** UI Unfiltered runs produced feature JSONs but stages 4/5/8 didn't discover them
- **Cause:** Stage 2.5 writes unfiltered outputs to `raw_unfiltered/`, but stages 4/5/8 hardcoded discovery for quality-tier folders only
- **Fix:** Added `raw_unfiltered` discovery/routing to all three downstream stages
- **Scope:** Path discovery/routing only; no analysis logic changed

---

## Session 2026-03-11 (Part 3) — Depth Metric Bug Fix

**Focus:** Diagnose and fix squat depth false-negative in `core/exevision/stages/scoring.py`.

**Root-cause diagnosis & fix:**

**Issue: `calculate_vertical_depth()` bilateral averaging bug**
- **Symptom:** Video 49226_1 scored `squat_depth = -0.099`, `below_parallel = false` despite visible below-parallel squat
- **Investigation:** All 71 rep frames showed negative bilateral average despite high confidence (hip 99.9%, knee 93.8%)
- **Per-leg diagnosis at frame 47:**
  - `L_Hip_Y: 0.8397, L_Knee_Y: 0.8134` → `L_Disp: +0.0263` ✅ (correct)
  - `R_Hip_Y: 0.8429, R_Knee_Y: 0.8728` → `R_Disp: -0.0299` ❌ (Z-drift artifact on far side)
  - Bilateral average: `-0.0018` (false negative)
- **Root cause:** Diagonal/front-side camera view: farther knee's Z-depth projects into drifted 2D Y; high confidence ≠ accurate position
- **Fix:** Per-leg independent computation; return `max()` of valid candidates; one valid leg sufficient
- **Outcome:** Left leg correctly produces `+0.0263`; `below_parallel = true`; rep score now non-zero

## Session 2026-03-07 — View Classification Robustness

**Focus:** Fix view classification edge cases; robust phase recovery for temporal segmentation.

**Root-cause analysis & fixes:**

**Issue: Stage 4 diagonal ambiguity**
- **Problem:** Visibility-based classifier could misclassify diagonals because MediaPipe hallucinates face landmarks even on back views
- **Evidence:**
  - Video 25728_1 (front-angled): face confidence 0.0 but remaining trackable → would be mistaken for back
  - Video 25886_1 (truly back): nose + eyes at ~0.999 confidence (hallucination) but nose depth far behind hips (`nose_rel_z ≈ +0.392`)
- **Root cause:** Face visibility/confidence = model certainty, not camera-facing geometry
- **Fix:** Diagonal disambiguation via **nose-vs-hip Z-depth** instead of face confidence
  - `nose_z < avg_hip_z` → `front_side` (nose physically closer to camera)
  - `nose_z > avg_hip_z` → `back_side` (nose physically farther)
- **Why:** Nose is anatomically front-facing; its depth relative to hip plane directly reveals subject orientation
- **Validation:** Video 25886_1 now yields `back_side` with 60/60 frame votes

**Issue: Stage 5 sequence robustness**
- **Status:** Now uses strict sequence sanitation + explicit transition constraints (not startup normalization helpers)
- **Behavior:** Illegal adjacency repaired in-place; `isometric` only from `eccentric` after sustained hold; shallow thresholds tuned for early eccentric capture
- **Deployed:** In `core/exevision/stages/temporal_segmentation.py`

## Session 2026-03-05 — Visibility-Based View Refactor

**Focus:** Improve robustness of view classification (stage 4) and pipeline continuity.

**Changes:**

1. **Stage 4 refactor** (`core/exevision/stages/classify_views.py`):
   - Replaced rotation-angle/facing-signal voting with **visibility-based frame classification**
   - Eliminated hard fallback-to-`side`; returns `unknown` only when zero trackable frames
   - Per-frame voting: face/eye/ear visibility + shoulder width → concrete label or `unknown`

2. **Stage 5 update** (`core/exevision/stages/temporal_segmentation.py`):
   - Added `'unknown'` to `VALID_VIEWS` set
   - Accepts all valid views including `unknown`; lets pose quality determine success
   - No longer rejects on questionable view; gracefully degrades instead

**Rationale:**
- Old approach (Z-coordinate rotation): brittle on back views (MediaPipe hallucinates face)
- New approach (visibility): intuitive & robust; "can I see the face?" is ground truth
- Removing hard `side` fallback: bad data now honest (`unknown`) rather than hidden
- Stage 5 graceful degradation: processes or fails based on actual pose quality, not view label semantics

**Expected outcome:**
- Pipeline continuity: stage 4 outputs concrete label or `unknown` (never surprises)
- Diagnostic clarity: `unknown` signals poor frame tracking; stage 5 logs show actual failure points
